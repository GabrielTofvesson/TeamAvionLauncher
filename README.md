### What is Team Avion Launcher (TAL)?
Team Avion Launcher (TAL) Is an open source java launcher for all of Team Avion's content. Team Avion is a small development team that creates modpacks and mods for the community. This Launcher will have a custom Minecraft launcher so players can play our custom modpacks and/or create their own modpacks and share them free of any hassle. TAL will also be the best platform to communicate with others that play the game.
